# Sorting-Algorithms

A visual representation of how different sorting algorithms work. In this project, the following algorithms have been worked on:

1. Bubble Sort
2. Insertion Sort
3. Selection Sort
4. Merge Sort
5. Quick Sort
6. Heap Sort
7. Radix Sort
8. Count Sort
9. Bucket Sort

Click on the top left menu icon to see visuals, and play around with different sized arrays. 

For an empirical analysis, we see how these algorithms behave under different array sizes, starting from 100 all the way to 100,000. For avoiding unresponsiveness from the webpage, bubble sort has not been computed for array sizes 50,000 and 100,000. A line graph further demonstrates the differences in performance among the algorithms
